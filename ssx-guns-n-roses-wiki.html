The first part of this Effortpost will clarify various controversies on the topic. The second part will explain why neoliberals should support Israel.

I’m going to preface, what will be an absolute clusterfuck of a review, by saying that none of the administrative issues are Zippy’s fault and I will not lay a single finger of blame on him.
