                            <p> http://www.kongregate.com/games/boyarkin/shcool-clicker. seriously, the last of us seems a little more advanced compared to say Uncharted, like this game has a larger skill set, more things you need to know about the different types of zombies, with Uncharted it's "loud or quiet" and guns and ammo are everywhere. With this game, you've got limited ammo, melee weapons break, you need to know how certain zombies react to noise, movement and all that. I can only find myself doing 1 or 2 sections at a time before I'm going "Oh man, that was tense 
Hi there! We are dealing with the growing problem of cell phone use in class and we are trying to see how other professors are dealing with it to have a better understanding of this global pattern. Basically I am curious to see if your school has an actual official policy or if it's each department, program, professor makes their own choice and states it on the syllabi. If you ban them during class and you catch them texting and such, do you stop lecturing (posted this to r/medicalschool to get the point of view of people who made it to med school, but alas they seemed to forget that they were once premeds and straight up deleted it. Anyways, so I just got out of yet another lecture in which I pretty much got jack shit from. I really just wanna see what y'all do and if people feel similar about this. striked through shit is what was directed to the med students) ~~Hey everyone, lowly premed here. Just wanted to ask if y'all actually went to lectu. I don't really like the orange Colour. I would kill to have my gauge cluster Blue instead. its the digital cluster, not the Old school clicker one. has anybody done this? is it easy?. Hi /r/webdev, I need help; I'm trying to put together a cookie clicker type game by following a bunch of tutorials and honestly it's just so I can learn a bit of javascript/jquery. So on my local xampp (and on my website (https://patrick-roelofs.com/other/school/clicker/game.php)) I get an error called gt Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'amount' of undefined. I tried reproducing the error on \(codepen.io\) ( But it does not produce the error. Since school is about to start next week and I remember u/KatKat23421 did this last year, I decided to do one for this year where any current students as well as alumni to post their tips and advice to push through university. Mods: if you guys don’t mind sticking the thread until 2 weeks after school has started. Well, here are my list of tips and advice from my 3 years here at UH 1. Always carry an umbrella with you. Houston is known for its bipolar weather. 2. Carry deodorant.

In my case it was in Left Behind in Grounded mode, specifically in the last area of the expansion, where the hunters are trying to break the padlock in the door, in hard or survivor that area wasn't much of a challenge, but in Grounded I required, no lying, +40 tries to finally beat it, and when I did if felt so so awesome, so I would like to know about you and the hardest parts in this majestic. </p>
